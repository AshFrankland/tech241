# The 4 Pillars of OOP
### Object-Oriented Programing

##### Abstraction:
Is the process of hiding the finer details where they aren't wanted.
In Python OOP, this is an extension of what we've already achieved using functions,
you don't need to outline the steps of every decision being made.  
For example, making a coffee:
* Not Abstracted:
  * Fill Kettle
  * Boil Water
  * Put Coffee in Mug
  * Pour Boiling Water
  * Add Milk (optional)
  * Stir
* Abstracted:
  * Make Coffee

It may seem silly, but in a large enough code base
having functions that do more things individually
will save a lot of time and effort.

##### Encapsulation:
Means that objects/classes should be self-contained without dependencies.
It's also good for protecting important variables/objects.

##### Inheritance:
Is where objects/classes can take variables and methods from a
parent/base object/class.

##### Polymorphism:
Is where inherited variables/methods can be altered from their
parent/base object/class.
