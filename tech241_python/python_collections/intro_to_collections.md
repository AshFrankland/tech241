# Intro to Collections

We looked at 5 different types of collections in Python:
* Lists `list`
  * Contained in square brackets `[]`,
  they are ordered and mutable.
* Tuples `tuple`
  * Contained in round brackets `()`,
  they are ordered and immutable.
* Dictionaries `dict`
  * Contained in curly brackets `{}` and require `key: value` pairs,
  they are unordered and mutable.
* Sets `set`
  * Contained in curly brackets `{}` also,
  but only contains values,
  they are also unordered and mutable.
* Frozen Sets `frozenset`
  * Need to be generated with the `frozenset()` function,
  they are unordered and immutable.
